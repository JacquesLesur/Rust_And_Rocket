# RUST with ROCKET 

## I am starting working with RUST by creating a classical back getting datas from a postgresql DB.

## TOOLS

[RUST](https://www.rust-lang.org) (with cargo --> package mnager)

Postgresql

[Rocket](https://rocket.rs) (web framework for Rust)

## Install

1. [Install rust and cargo] (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Creat a database and a table account with a user_id an a username
3. Edit the connexion string in the .env file
4. Lunch the project with "cargo run" from your main directory

## Usage

This is just a little project to train myself with rust and Rocket. Easy to setup, Rocket is a realy good framework !
